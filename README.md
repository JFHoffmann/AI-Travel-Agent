# AI-Travel-Agent
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
The AI Travel Agent offers personalized travel arragement services for the users. It searches for the best options based on user preferences, trip history and other users experiencess.

## Background
The problems that travel agents usually face are:
* they need to sort through vast amounts of information
* too many possible routes
* the flight and accomodation rates vary greatly by date
* manual searchs are slow and tedious
 
## How is it used?
The AI Travel Agent will assist travellers planning their holidays. The user will provide her preferences on various aspects such as schedule, budget, type of travel (adventure, luxury...), transports (plane, train...), must-see places, accommodation preferences, special needs or dietary restrictions. 

Based on a combination of factors the AI Travel Agent will calculate different routes and propose various detailed plans and estimated total costs:
* different starting and ending locations
* best pricing
* best time of the year
* availability of hotel accommodations
* best flight times
* the user preferences and restritions
* the user feedback from her trip history
* other user's experiences

Once the user selects the preferred option, the AI Travel Agent will assist buying all the tickets and needed reservations, propose insurance options based on risk, and provide local cultural and entertainment suggestions that would need buying tickets in advance. 

During the trip, the AI Travel Agent assistance will be available providing any information and additional suggestions. It will adapt to any changes that may come up (delayed flights, adverse weather forecasts or other unexpected events). It will calculate how it affects the current schedule and cost and will propose any needed changes.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data for the application will come from the AI Travel Agent database. 
It will use metasearch engines, transportation sites, online travel platforms, best hotel review sites, insurance companies sites, local events sites.

## Challenges
The final user validation and acceptance is needed. The travel might not consider unknown destinations. 

## What next?
A local guide assistant could be added. Using the user's location and information from Wikipedia, it could provide an audio summarized explanation.
