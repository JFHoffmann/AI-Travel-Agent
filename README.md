# AI-Travel-Agent
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
The AI Travel Agent offers personalized travel arragement services for the users. It searches for the best options based on user preferences, trip history and other users experiences offering various scenarios. Considering the schedule, cost restrictions and user's priorities it can plan vacacion travels by finding the best fares, making reservations and giving practical advise based on other traveller's experiences.

## Background

The problems that travel agents usually face are:

* they need to sort through vast amounts of information to find the best possible trip arrangements for their clients
* there are many possible routes
* the flight and accomodation rates vary greatly by date
* manual searchs are usually slow and tedious

However, the AI Travel Agent can help the user choose the best option by analyzing multiple options. Depending on the user's flexibility it can easily calculate various routes with different starting and ending locations. The AI Travel Agent can calculate the total travel costs for each travel option. It will also consider specific user prefences requirements and restritions, learning from their experiences and providing more personalized guidance in future travels.

## How is it used?
The AI Travel Agent will assist travellers planning their holidays. The user will provide her preferences on various aspects such as schedule (fixed/flexible), budget (preferred/maximum), type of travel (backpacker, adventure, luxury...), preferred types of transports (plain, train, bus, rental car...), must-see places, accommodation preferences (hotel, appartment, camping...), special needs (e.g.: limited physical mobility) or dietary restrictions. In case the user needs some recommendations, the AI Travel Agent will offer suggestions based on previous trips history. 

Based on a combination of factors the AI Travel Agent will calculate different routes and propose various detailed plans and estimated total costs. The system will consider:
* best pricing
* best time of the year
* availability of hotel accommodations
* best flight times
* the user preferences
* the user feedback from her trip history
* other user's experiences

Once the user selects the preferred option, the AI Travel Agent will assist buying all the tickets and needed reservations. Based on the risk the travel will encounter it will also propose the best insurance option. For each location the AI Travel Agent can provide local cultural and entertainment suggestions that would need buying tickets in advance. 

During the trip, the AI Travel Agent assistance will always be available on the user's phone, tablet or smartwatch providing any information and needed details. Based on the user's preferences, a daily plan will be available and reminders can be shown accordindly. Any additional cultural and entertainment suggestions can be requested by the user at any time. 
When needed, the AI Travel Agent will adapt to any changes that may come up. For example, this may be caused by delayed or cancelled flights, adverse weather forecasts or other unexpected events. The AI Travel Agent will calculate how the unexpected event affects the current schedule and cost and will propose any needed changes.
Once the user has returned from the holidays, she can provide a valuable feedback that the AI Travel Agent will take into consideration in the next opportunity.
For example:
* if a flight was unconfortable, next time a more confortable seat option will be chosen or the flight company will be discarded.
* if the traveller couldn't follow the plan, next time, the AI Travel Agent will propose some energy recharging activities in between.
* if the traveller loved the new activities, similar local experiences will be proposed on the next trip.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data for the application will come from the AI Travel Agent database which will store the users preferences, feedbacks and trips history.
For all the planning activities, it will use metasearch engines, online travel agencies websites, transportation sites, online travel platforms, best hotel review sites, insurance companies sites, networking and local events sites.

## Challenges
This tool will not decide whether the trip should be taken or not. The final user validation and acceptance is needed. As feedback from the user and the preferences from other users with similar preferences are taken into account, the travel might not consider unknown destinations. 

## What next?
A local guide assistant could be added. Using the user's location and information from Wikipedia, it could provide an audio summarized explanation.
